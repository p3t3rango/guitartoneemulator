# Guitar Tone Emulator VST

A VST plugin and standalone application inspired by the Quad Cortex by Neural DSP, designed to emulate guitar tones through tone matching and amp simulation.

## Project Overview

The Guitar Tone Emulator operates in two modes:

1. **Tone Matching Mode**: Upload a reference guitar track, isolate the guitar if needed, analyze its tone, and apply that tone to a raw guitar track.
2. **Amp Emulator Mode**: Functions as a traditional guitar amp simulator with presets and effects.

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Tone Matching Mode
- Support uploading reference guitar tracks (WAV, MP3)
- Guitar isolation from mixed tracks
- Tone analysis and extraction
- Real-time tone application to raw tracks

#### Amp Emulator Mode
- Amp modeling with presets (clean, distorted, vintage)
- Effects: distortion, chorus, reverb, cabinet emulation
- Parameter adjustments (gain, volume, EQ)
- Cabinet impulse responses (IRs) support

#### User Interface
- Quad Cortex-inspired design
- Knobs, sliders, buttons
- Visual signal chain
- Preset management
- Mode switching
- Track upload buttons

#### Standalone Application
- VST functionality replication
- File upload support
- Independent DAW operation

### Performance Requirements
- Real-time audio processing (< 10ms latency)
- Major DAW compatibility (Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Cubase)
- Common audio format support (WAV, MP3)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Windows and macOS support
- Open-source tools
- Scalable architecture
